# Nick S's nixos-config

This repository contains a [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for configuring my machines.

It's largely based on jnsgruk's excellent [nixos-config](https://github.com/jnsgruk/nixos-config/tree/main) which is both stylish and well-formatted.

[Misterio77/nix-starter-configs](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs/tree/main) has also been helpful.

I'm adding things incrementally instead of forking these repos as an opportunity to learn Nix in-depth.
